# Introduction To Economic Development

## What Is Economic Development?

### Sen's Definition:
1. Improving peoples well being and quality of life, this involves improvements in the standards of living.
2. Reductions in poverty and improved health/ education.
3. There must be high levels of freedom and economic choice.


### Todaro's Definition:
1. Availability and distribution of life sustaining goods, such as food, shelter and health
2. An increase in standards of living
3. Expansion and economic and social choice


Development is a normative concept, and we cannot define it neatly.

# Economic Growth vs Development

Growth does not equal development. Just because there is high GDP growth, that doesn't mean the country/ economy is developing.

## Why Is Growth Good For Development?
Health, jobs and infrastructure are the big drivers of development.

1. This leads to higher incomes
      * Better jobs and better quality of life as they can afford more material goods
      * Income inequality may go down
   * A reduction in poverty for people in the economy
2. Firms will make higher profits
     * Firms will have more confidence in the economy
       * This leads to them hiring more people
       * Make greater sales as the economy grows
       * If they reinvest their higher profits into research and development, that can lead to innovations in technology
         * This allows the economy to move away from the agriculture sector and help advance the economy (such as moving away from agriculture and moving to service sector)
     * High job creation as firms will want to employ more people to meet their demands (due to economic growth)
3. Fiscal dividends: Higher fiscal revenues for the government
     * The government can then spend money on things such as infrastructure and help develop the economy even further 

## Evaluation Of The Importance Of Growth For Development

1. There is no guarantee that growth will be distributed equally
     * This means that the standard of living has not increased for all people
     * Income inequality may hinder development as most of the money may be going to a small number of people
2. Negative externalities and problems with sustainability arise from growth
     * In the short run this is great for growth, but in the long run, the resources will disappear thanks to unsustainable growth
       * Without these resources then, the economic growth will not consistently grow, and the future generations will suffer
     * Also pollution from growth reduces the people's living standards in the economy
       * This is a drag on the economic development of a country
3. Is the growth just in one sector?
     * If the growth is happening in 1 sector, this is not going to help develop the entire economy.
     * Such as Nigeria, they have a massive oil sector that drives most of their GDP, but that doesn't mean that money is being spread around to the rest of the economy

Inclusive growth (growth for everyone) is **good**, but noninclusive growth is not.
Growth is necessary but *not* sufficient on it's own to make a country more economically **developed**. 

# Common Characteristics Of Developing Countries

## What Commonalities Do Developing Countries Share?

1. Low standards of living
     - Low incomes
     - High poverty
     - Bad job creation
2. Low levels of productivity
     - Lack of investment
     - Lack of capital, and lack of availability of capital
     - This means very low productivity
3. Low level of savings means they are trapped in very poorly paid jobs, meaning the chances of getting out of the poverty trap is very low
     - Lack of education on where to save and how to save the money
     - They may not even have money to save as they are on such low incomes
4. High population growth  
     - People tend to give birth to lots of children because the children are made to work in the farm to help the family
5. Primary sector dependence
     - Agriculture is normally the largest sector of the economy
     - These countries tend to be well endowed with natural resources
       - This means they put all of their factors of production in producing/ extracting those natural resources
     - But due to low productivity and poor capital, this doesn't necessarily mean they will have very much economic growth
6. Incomplete markets: Not all of necessary market forces are there
     - Lack of property rights
     - Their currencies tend to not be very strong, countries don't really want their money
7. High unemployment/ underemployment
     - High unemployment is due to the fact that the agricultural sector is dominant, which has low productivity
     - Low savings means there is not a lot of investment
       - Low capital
     - This hinders employment as it becomes very difficult to find one as there is not a lot of investment
     - Those that do find jobs can find themselves underemployed
     - There may even be a lot of people that do not want to be employed
       - This is the hidden unemployment of the economy
       - This means that the real unemployment rate may even be higher than what it is currently shown as
  
8. Low economic power on the international stage
     - This means they cannot fight trade wars
     - They don't have much of a say internationally
     - They can't ask about finance very easily
     - Ultimately, they cannot get their voice across in the international stage

## Evaluation:

1. Not all developing countries will have the same number of characteristics
2. Different countries will have different political structures, different cultures, different friends, etc.



# Measures Of Economic Development

## Single Indicators
These are indicators that look at just 1 thing.

### GDP Per Capita
  - This is the average income per person in the economy.
  - GDP doesn't tell us about negative externalities, pollution, income inequality, etc.
  - What we tend to use instead of GDP/Capita is Gross National Income
    - GNI looks at the income generated by all of the country's factors of production regardless of the location
    - Labour is a classic example, people from a country may leave and work abroad, but then they send money back home
    - A lot of the money tends to be repatriated
    - Also, developing countries can attract lots of FDI
      - But a lot of the money made by the TNC's tend to be repatriated back into the TNC's home country
  - If we use either GNI or GDP/capita, we want to have them in terms of Purchasing Power Parity
    - This allows us to have better comparisons between the standards of living in each country
    - This is because different countries have different prices for goods and services, so adjusting for PPP is good
  
### Health Of People In The Economy
 - Such as: Life expectancy, and infant mortality
 - Improvements in health imply:
   - Increasing life expectancy implies that the health care treatment is getting better in the country
   - Also means that there are lots of doctors, implying that there are lots of jobs for higher skilled people
   - Doctors need to go to higher education so it also implies that the education in the country is improving
   - Sanitation may be another thing that is improving in the economy to allow people living longer
   - Access to hospitals may be very high
   - Education on prevention of these diseases may also be very high
  
### The Education Of People In The Economy
 - Such as: Adult literacy and enrolment in primary education
 - Improvements in education imply:
   - That educational institutions are strong
   - There are teachers getting jobs to educate people
   - Potential for higher skill jobs improves
   - Number of people that can do higher skill jobs improves
     - This leads to lower unemployment
     - Leading to higher incomes for the country

## The Human Development Index (HDI):

The HDI is a measure of economic development calculated by the UN. 
It is an example of a ***composite index***.

It is calculated using these 3 factors:
1. Life expectancy
2. The mean years of schooling of adults that are 25 years old + and the expected years of school a typical five year old will go through
3. Income measured by the **Gross National Income per Capita** of the country. 

 The higher the HDI, the greater the development.

### Advantages Of Using HDI: 
1. Takes multiple different variables into account
2. Easy to calculate because governments already collect the data required to calculate the HDI

### Disadvantages Of Using HDI:
1. Quality of life and quality of education is not factored in
    - Someone may have a long life but terrible health
    - Someone may have many years of education but the education was terrible
2. There is no consideration of income inequality
   - The GNI per capita may be high but most of the income may be going to a few number of people
3. There are other very crucial factors to look at when examining development, such as levels of freedom and state of the environment

However, since HDI is only an indicator and not a precise measure, it should not be expected to be perfect.


## Other Indicators:

### Inequality Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI):

This is an adjustment of HDI which includes inequality as the 4th indicator.

### The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI):
- This measures the percentage of the population that is multidimensional poor. 
  - It uses data for health, education and standard of living but uses a broader range of indicators within these categories.
- It highlights the countries where some people are extremely rich, but the majority is not.
- The **problem** with this measure is that the data required to calculate it may not always be available, it also does not take into account the environment.


# Factors Influencing Growth and Development

## Economic Factors

### 1. Primary Product Dependency:

Primary products are goods such as commodities and raw materials.

Having an economy that is dependent on primary products causes problems for the following reasons:

- Natural disasters can wipe out the production plants of primary products (such as crops)
   1. This means there will be no production
   2. No production means no income generated
   3. No income leads to standards of living dropping
- Primary products tend to have a ***low*** Income Elasticity of Demand (YED).
   1. This means primary products are *inferior*, or *normal* goods, so as incomes of people go up, their demand for primary products don't go up very much
   2. Instead, their demand for manufactured goods increases, this is because manufactured goods are likely to be luxury goods as they are not necessities
- The ***Prebisch Singer hypothesis*** suggests that the **long run price** of primary goods **declines** in *proportion* to manufactured goods.
      - This means as the price of manufactured goods go down, the price of primary products go down also
      - But this has shown to be false in certain circumstances, the prices of primary products such as oil has increased over the last few decades while the price of manufactured goods has decreased (thanks to Chinese exports).
- Dutch disease is another big problem
   1. This is when a country starts exporting lots of their primary goods in a short amount of time, leading to the appreciation of their currency
   2. This is because as demand for their exports increase, the demand for their currency also increases
   3. As the currency appreciates, their exports become more and more expensive internationally
   4. This leads to decreased price competitiveness throughout the economy, and causes a fall in output for certain industries.
      - This occurred for the non-oil sectors in Nigeria.

Some countries have managed to develop using their primary product dependence, such as Saudi Arabia.

### 2. Volatility of Commodity Prices

Primary products tend to have inelastic demand and supply curves, which means small changes in either demand or supply lead to huge fluctuations in price.

- These changes mean that producers have very unstable incomes.
  - Instability means it is difficult to plan for the future and therefore it is difficult to make long term investments
  - Another problem for producers is that their incomes may shrink rapidly thanks to volatility of commodity prices, which can then lead to poverty and a much lower standard of living
- When prices of commodities rise for a number of years, this just tends to be increases in price thanks to over-investment. 
  - This over-investment then pumps up the price and when the investment money is no longer flooding in, it causes the commodity prices to fall, which leads to problems as mentioned earlier

### 3. Savings Gap

1. Developing nations tend to have low incomes due to unemployment/ under-employment
2. This ultimately means they are not saving as much as the *marginal propensity to save* is quite low when incomes are also low
3. Without people saving, banks don't have a lot of money to lend out to firms for investment
4. Without investment, technological innovation and capital accumulation is vastly slowed down, which results in the economy having very low productivity (no capital machinery), and low productivity leads to very low economic output
   1. Another point to make is that the *long run aggregate supply* curve will be at a very low output
   2. This means the economy cannot produce very much at max capacity
   3. If demand increases without the *long run aggregate supply* increasing (it only increases when the quality or quantity of factors of production in the economy increase), then this leads to high rates of inflationary growth.
   4. Inflationary growth is terrible as it raises price levels very high without also increasing output very much.

The savings rate in Africa is around 17% of the GDP.

The **Harrod-Domar model** of growth suggests that savings provide the funds which are borrowed for investment purposes.

- This means the rate of growth for a country is based on the level of savings it has
- The model concludes that economic growth is down to the amount of labour and capital in an economy
  - Developing nations tend to have a lot of labour available, so their growth must be hindered by the fact that they don't have any capital
  - Therefore, in order to accumulate capital:
    1. Investment is required to buy capital
    2. Investments are funded by banks, banks need money to lend out
    3. Banks get their money from deposits
    4. Deposits are given into the bank in the form of savings
    5. Therefore savings are required to start the chain towards economic growth.
- However, there are some criticisms of the model:
  1. Economic growth is not economic *development*, meaning living standards may not rise (which is the main goal).
     - So if living standards don't rise, then it is not a very effective model to help development
  2. It is very difficult to save when you don't have any money. This is the case for people in poor countries, with a terrible job.
  3. Savings can lead to increased investments, but investments may not always lead to growth. This is because the money may be wasted or ineffectively spent.    


### 4. Foreign Currency Gaps

A foreign currency gap occurs when a country does not have the required amounts of foreign currency reserves to be able to purchase capital from abroad.

- The reason capital is normally bought from abroad is that developing nations tend to not have specialist capital inside of their countries
- Therefore they have to import it from abroad to get specialist capital and increase their productivity and output
- The gap can be caused by low exports relative to imports. 

A country that suffers from a foreign currency gap is Ethiopia.

- In 2018 their public debt was 60% of GDP
- Most of the debt has to be paid in foreign currencies and not their own.
- This means it is likely they do not have enough foreign currency to pay off their debt.

### 5. Capital Flight

Capital flight is when large amounts of capital is moved out of the country and sent elsewhere instead of being used there. This means there is less capital stock in the economy.

A good example of capital flight is money. Let's use a real life example:
  1. Money is moved out of Argentinian banks in 2001
  2. Banks without money cannot give out loans, or even give out cash to those that want to withdraw
  3. Everyone realises that money is running out and so they rush to withdraw, this is called a bank run
  4. The bank doesn't have enough liquidity to give out, leading to a crisis and people lose faith in the system

So why does capital flight occur?

1. People lack confidence in the country's stability or financial systems
2. People want to hide it away from the government, maybe for tax reasons.
3. TNC's may want to repatriate their profits in their home countries, so they send money back.

### 6. Demographic Factors

1. Developing countries tend to have higher population growth.
   - 5% population growth a year means the economy also has to grow by 5% a year to maintain living standards in the economy
   - This ultimately means that developing countries need higher rates of growth to develop compared to developed countries with lower birth rates
2. The high population growth is caused by high birth rates.
   - High birth rates means more children, children are "dependants".
   - More dependants mean less money for everyone as they need to support the dependants.
   - More children also means strains on schooling and education
   - Youth unemployment may increase, leading to negative social impacts with negative externalities, such as crime.

The population of Africa is expected to more than double by the year 2050.


### 7. Debt

1. Developing countries in the 1980's received huge loans from developing nations
2. Now they suffer from the massive interest repayments
3. This means they have less money to spend on the public sector
4. To finance the debt they may have to raise taxes, which will reduce consumption 
5. This will hinder growth even more.

Nigerias debt is 52% of their GDP.

### 8. Access To Credit And Banking

1. Developing nations have a very limited access to credit and banking
2. This means they cannot get loans to finance investment projects to try stimulating/ expanding the economy
3. A problem in developing nations is that people have to resort to *loan sharks* for loans, which is dangerous and may leave individuals permanently in debt.


### 9. Infrastructure

1. Low levels of infrastructure make it difficult and raise the cost of production for firms
2. This is because the cost of transportation increases as roads are not good and so longer routes may have to be taken
3. Terrible transport links mean the movement of goods may be disrupted very suddenly
4. This means foreign firms are less likely to invest and set up in your country, and the firms already in your country will have a much harder time expanding


### 10. Education And Skills

1. Poor education within these countries mean workers have very little skills
   - This means they will not be very productive either
   - Low productivity stunts economic growth as it means the LRAS of the economy will not be very high
2. However there is a problem with *over-education*, this is when graduates from university are unable to find graduate level jobs and so they have to take other, unskilled ones.


### 11. Absence Of Property Rights

1. Property rights are essential as individuals need to feel as if their assets are safe
2. High levels of property rights mean investors are not afraid of their assets being taken or stolen, making them more likely to invest into the country
  
A country where there was poor property rights is Zimbabwe, the country took away the farms and land of many farmers and this eventually lead to economic collapse, as well as mass starvation in the country.


## Non Economic Factors

### 12. Corruption

Many developing countries suffer from **corruption**, this means politicians and people in power are maximising their own welfare while disregarding the country's welfare.

1. This could arguably be another example of the principal agent problem.
2. Corruption is linked with having high levels of bureaucracy
   - If there is a lot of government control over the country then more people are needed to manage everything (bureaucrats).
   - Having more bureaucrats leads to an increased likelihood of corruption

### 13. Disease

Countries with high levels of HIV/AIDS, or malaria have a very difficult time developing. 
1. This is because a lot of the potential workforce are not able to work as they are not healthy.
2. A lot of money also has to be spent on medical care (if they can afford it).
3. If they are working then their productivity will be low as they are sick
4. Also, having a lot of ill people in the economy means there are a high number of dependants in the economy
   - This means more money is spent taking care of the dependants
   - This reduces the amount of money saved in the economy
   - Low savings lead to low investment, and makes economic growth more difficult.

### 14. Poor Climate

Countries with very harsh/ poor climates will find it difficult to grow the economy.

1. This may be because farmers cannot set up farms there
2. Another reason is that there may be a high likelihood of natural disasters
   - This puts off foreign investors as natural disasters can lead to their investment being ruined

### 15. Civil War

Civil war causes:

1. Political instability
   - This leads to investors thinking the country is too unstable to invest in
   - Investors want very stable government so that they can plan for the future and in the long term
2. War destroys infrastructure
3. High levels of poverty
4. Disease tends to spread during war time

# Measures Of Income Inequality

## The Lorenz Curve

- The further the Lorenz curve is from the line of perfect equality, the more unequal the distribution of income is.

\vspace{0.6\textheight}


## The Gini Coefficient

- The Gini coefficient takes the Lorenz curve and gives us a numerical measure of the income inequality in the country.
- 0 means **perfect *equality***
- 1 means **perfect *inequality*** \

**The equation for the Gini coefficient:** \begin{huge} $\frac{SectionA}{SectionA + SectionB}$ \end{huge}

\newpage


# Strategies & Policies That Influence Development & Growth

## Institutional Factors

### 1. Education:

**Why are improvements to education likely to boost development and growth?**

1. Education leads to **high productivity**, which promotes development
2. The more educated people there are, the higher the chance they are going to be in **better paying jobs** and have higher incomes
  - This means they can afford to purchase more material goods for their family, making them more well off
  - More education also leads to increase levels of social and economic choice, which according to Sen and Todaro is integral to economic *development*.
3. **Educating women** also promotes higher levels of development as they are more responsible, and more willing to purchase merit goods such as better education for their children, which in the long run will help development much more.
4. **Health benefits** can also be bought about by educating people on health risks such as HIV, which may be a reason for the lack of development in the country.
   1. Another thing to educate people on is contraceptive usage, this will prevent the spread of things such as HIV and also help *reduce* the rapidly growing populations.
5. **Technological advancements** can also be bought about by educating people, as then they have knowledge and can create new technologies in the economy.

**But the problem with using education as a policy to promote development is:**

1. There are issues with *funding*, education tends to be very expensive.
   1. If the government were to allow private education however, then there's the moral dilemma of whether it is fine for children to be discriminated against because of the amount of money they can pay.
2. There may be some underlying issues in society that make education ineffective
   1. One example of this may be that when children grow to a certain age, they may be expected to leave education and help support their family by taking up a job
      1. Therefore in some countries we may see a lot of primary school enrolment but little to no high school enrolment.


### 2. Health Care

**Why is good health care important to development and growth?**

1. The healthier people are, the more **productive** they will be
2. The more **jobs can be created** in the economy if there are lots of hospitals, GP's and dental practices.
3. **Standards of living will increase** as people are healthier
   1. Healthier people also tend to be *happier*, which is very important for the economy as happier people tend to be more productive also.
4. It also implies **better sanitation** and **cleaner drinking water**.
   1. These are all indicators that development is occurring in the country and people's lives are being improved.

**But the problem with trying to improve health in the economy is that**

1. There may be a *lack of funds* available to allocate to health facilities.
2. If the private sector gets involved with health care (which eliminates the problem of a lack of funding), is it really fair that people can be *declined health care* because they cannot pay the prices?

### 3. Infrastructure

Infrastructure is key to economic development and growth.

**Why is good infrastructure important to development and growth?**

1. Good infrastructure means **markets will be available**.
   1. This is because good infrastructure allows markets to come together, an example of this is *roads*.
   2. Without any roads in the UK, goods cannot be delivered to buyers.
2. Another great effect of good infrastructure is that **access to schools and hospitals** will become better.
   1. This allows sick people to get to a hospital quicker, and kids do not have to abandon school because it is too far away or unreachable.
   2. This ultimately means that *infrastructure is key* to the effectiveness of policies that aim to *improve schooling and health care*.
      1. Without infrastructure, those policies will not be effective at all.

**But the problem with improving infrastructure is:**

1. It is *very expensive*.
   1. Developing countries tend to not have enough money to invest into roads and things.
2. It is a supply side policy so it *may take years for the effect to be displayed*.


### 4. Taxation

Tax revenue is also called *fiscal dividends*.

**Taxation can actually hinder economic development and growth:**

1. There may be high levels of **corruption**, meaning the tax revenue is not being used to help the public, and rather goes to politician pockets instead.
   1. This is was a big problem with India, there was corruption at the highest levels of government but after 2014, the newly elected government have almost completely eliminated the corruption at the top.
2. Tax exemptions may be given to corporations that work closely with the government, this is another form of corruption.
3. Since there is typically *low corporate activity* in developing countries, the government often gives **tax incentives** to TNC's to start production there.
   1. This means the government cannot raise taxes on those TNC's as they have promised not to, decreasing the level of tax revenue they could be earning.
4. Developing nations also have large **informal markets**, and with informal markets, it is very difficult to collect any tax revenue.
5. Thanks to **the WTO**, tariffs (and protectionist measures in general) have been falling.
   1. Tariffs happen to be a very good source of tax revenue for the government.

### 5. Appropriate use of technology


1. It is important for the economy to harness and **use technology appropriately**.
   1. An example of this is solar cookers. These cookers can harness the sun in very hot countries to cook food, which is cheaper and more sustainable in the long run than using gas.
2. It is also important to try **using technology that have synergies with your country**.
   1. This means using technology that will not be hindered by your country's conditions, such as using solar panels in the Arctic circle.
3. **Weather based technologies** are also a good usage of technology.
   1. In India, farmers are using technologies to help them predict the weather, this then allows them to plan for predicted weather.
   2. This then greatly improves agricultural productivity and economic growth.

### 6. Female equality

If women are placed on the same footing as men, then it can greatly help development of the economy.

**Why is female equality important to development?**

1. Women with children will be able to **improve their children's health**.
   1. This may come in the form of vaccinations, better nutrition, etc.
   2. This will then reduce infant mortality and help drive down fertility rates.
2. Women in education will know that education is important, so **they will promote education** to their own families.
   1. This leads to higher incomes for the family and better development overall.
3. Women make up 50% of the population, so having 50% more people in the work force will lead to **economic growth and lower unemployment**.
   1. This then leads to higher national incomes and better standards of living.
4. Women may want to have **smaller families**.
   1. This is because if they want to send their kids to good universities, they understand that it is better to have fewer kids (more economically viable).
   2. Rising incomes also seems to have an inverse correlation with the fertility rate.

### 7. Income distribution

If income is very unequally distributed then it may create problems for the development of the country.

**Why is unequal income distribution bad for development?**

1. If people do not get a good amount of income, then it will lead to a **lack of savings**.
   1. This then prevents investment from taking place.
2. In developing countries, the richer people tend to be *bureaucrats and politicians*, meaning they will enact policy to keep themselves rich, and not really care about the poor.
3. **Capital flight** may also occur, since rich people have a lot of money thanks to unequal income distributions, they may then send it *out* of the economy.


## Political Stability

In developing countries, political stability is very important for the overall development of the country.

### The benefits of political stability:

1. There is a higher chance of **FDI** into the country
   1. This is because firms know that there is no corrupt bureaucracy in the country that will hinder their profits
   2. There is no unnecessary regulation and very little red tape.
2. If the country requires **aid**, then they are more likely to get it because people know the government is stable and trust worthy.
3. If politicians are put into power through **democracy**, then they will ensure that they keep on doing things that are good for the people to ensure they are still in power.
   1. This is the benefit of democracy.

### Negatives of political instability:

1. There may be a **loss of infrastructure**.
   1. This may be due to civil conflict and war.
2. There is also a **loss of investment**, because investors will be afraid to put their money in an unstable country.

**A major threat to development is *corruption***, which may manifest itself in a multitude of ways:

1. **Inefficient regulations**: This is when corporations are not following regulations and the government turns a blind eye to it.
2. **Reduced FDI** flows due to foreign investors not willing to risk dealing with a corrupt government.
3. **Bribes**: Businesseses may have to pay bribes to expand their business, which in turn raises their costs of production.
4. Projects given to the **highest bidder**, rather than the *most efficient producer*.
5. **Legal corruption**: Laws may not be properly enforced and the judicial system may not be very effective as they are corrupt.

**This ultimately leads to government failure, and a misallocation of resources.**


# The Poverty Cycle

**Absolute poverty is when** someone is living with an amount of money below a certain threshold.

**Relative poverty is when** someone is living with money that is below the average.

**Why are people in poverty?**

1. A lack of opportunity for jobs in an economy
2. Lack of skills
3. Lack of education

## The Economic *Growth* Poverty Cycle:

\vspace{0.30\textheight}

1. **Low incomes in the economy**
2. This means that there is going to be a **low level of savings**.
   1. This may also be due to a lack of financial institutions in the economy
3. Low level of savings leads to a **low level of investment**.
4. Without investment there will be **low economic growth**.
5. Low economic growth means *low incomes*, and the cycle repeats.

## The Economic *Development* Poverty Cycle:

\vspace{0.30\textheight}

The development poverty cycle stems from the *growth* poverty cycle.


1. There are **low incomes** thanks to the growth poverty cycle.
2. In a country with *low incomes*, it is **hard for the government to fund education and health**
   1. This means people will have to pay for education and health *at the point of consumption*, and since there are low incomes, a lot of people may not be able to afford it.
3. This then leads to **low levels of human capital** in the economy.
   1. This essentially means workers have very low levels of skills.
4. If people do however find jobs, there will still be **low levels of productivity**.
   1. This is due to bad training and low level of skills.
   2. Low productivity then leads to low incomes, and then the cycle starts again.

# Micro Finance

**What is micro finance?** The distribution of small loans to individuals entrepeneurs or groups of people to stimulate business activity, profits and incomes.

## What Are The Benefits Of Micro Finance?

1. It helps **fill the savings gap**
   1. This is because it allows people to acess finance and grow their businesses
   2. Traditional banks would likely charge high interest rates or maybe not give credit to these people because they will not want to take the risk (as the banks do not have acess to very much money to hand out).
2. It **can relieve poverty** by allowing smaller businesses to expand and earn higher incomes.
3. It is a source of finance **without huge interest rates**.
   1. This means small businesses won't be in debt of huge amounts of money.
4. It can help **empower women**.
   1. This can be hugely beneficial in development of the economy.

## What Are The Problems With Micro Finance?

1. Lots of **businesses fail**
   1. So how do the loans get paid back?
2. Lenders can still apply **exorbitent interest rates** and bully the borrowers.
   1. Over the recent years, the scheme has seen problems of lenders behaving more like loan sharks than traditional lenders.
3. **Loans may not be big enough to alleviate poverty**.
   1. This is because in developing nations, private firms handle a lot of sectors of the economy which the government does not have enough funding for, such as schools.
   2. This then means the person who was given the loan, may actually spend a lot of it on school, health, etc.
   3. This means that a lot of the money is being *used for consumption*, rather than for investment.


# Evaluating Different Strategies For Growth

## Market Based Strategies

**What are some examples of market based strategies?**

1. Promoting **FDI** into the country.
2. **Privatisation** of certain industries.
3. **Deregulation** of industries.
4. **Trade liberalisation** by taking away protectionist measures.
5. **Reducing the size of the government**
6. **Removal of government subsidies**.
7. **Floating exchange rate** systems.
8. **Micro finance** schemes.


### What are the benefits of market based strategies?

1. Free market economists argue that there is **a more efficent allocation of resources** in a free market.
   1. This is because government intervention can distort the price signal.
   2. Another reason is that a lot of government intervention leads to government failure, such as corruption and excessive red tape.
2. They also argue that **free markets promote competition** and the profit motive will mean that firms will invest to be dynamically efficient.
   1. This is so that their costs can decrease and then they will be able to earn higher levels of profits.
   2. Firms also want to supply what consumers *demand*, and firms will know what consumers want much more than the government, which means allocative efficiency.
   3. Economists will argue that state run firms are very x inefficient, as they have no profit motive, so they have no reason to cut costs.
3. It also **encourages FDI**
   1. This is because firms know that there won't be any red tape, no unecessary regulations, and no corruption as there is very little government intervention.

### However, what are the problems with market based strategies?

There are some problems with allowing markets to run freely.

1. Will there be **infrastructure developments?**
   1. Private sector firms are less likely to develop these projects
2. Free markets **may not efficiently allocate resources at the social optimum levels**
   1. This is because public goods will have a *missing market*, and merit goods may be *under-produced*, while demerit goods may be *over-produced*.
   2. Important sectors of the economy such as education, health care and defence may not be allocated the right amount of resources in a free market.
3. There may be **market failures**, such as environment problems.
   1. Resource depletion, pollution, and other negative externalities reduce social welfare in the economy.
4. **Income inequality** tends to increase in a market economy.
   1. Without any government support and intervention, people on lower incomes will have no safety net to help them if they are unemployed, or disabled.
5. **Protectionism in advanced economies** may limit your growth as their markets are not freely accessible.
6. A **lack of well-functioning financial institutions**.
   1. This means there won't be places where people will deposit their savings in, and that leads to a savings gap.
   2. Therefore we may need government intervention to ensure there are financial institutions present for consumers to use.
